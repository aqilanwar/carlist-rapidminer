2014,Daily User review,Its what you pay for a entry level vehicle. Very comfortable and useful in tight city areas but not recommended for long distance journeys. Practically good for errands and daily tasks.
2014,A good car for new married couple an fresh graduat,"I've been using this car daily, almost 150k millage now. I havent facing any major issues, service done on time at Perodua Services Centre. The car is really sturdy, although it might not have the power, it is suffice for daily ride in the city or going to the supermarket. Handling is good for a small car but dont expect to drive more that 120km/h comfortably though. I believe that for this car, if you always discipline on the service time, keep it standard, always check for wear and tear parts on every services occasion, it can last for 10 more years."
2014,Really good car,Best car for ehailing. Petrol saving
2014,"Eco-friendly, Budget, Easy to park","One word for Perodua Axia ""Worth"""
2014,Really Economic Car,"For me, this car is the best to get from point A-B. Suits for daily working use"
2014,Economic Style and User Friendly,"Save Fuel & Easy Handling , comfort level medium and cabin enough space."
2015,Agile + Not enough but Fun,"Agile car that still give confidence to throw car around corners (maybe just me). Not enough power is common complaints, sometimes throttle responses lag terribly. But if properly fell the car response, throttle become light & immediate power. Not a car for highway/long distance but a racing car (maybe for me) at backroad/village road"
2015,Overall Very Good,"The car is pretty small and short so it's easy to drive anywhere! Parking, narrow road, sensor and others are pretty good too! Another thing is, it's fuel saving! That's the point!"
2015,Overall the car is good and economic,have been using this car over 4 years so far everything is good except the engine (power/cc).
2015,Small car less maintenance but power no compromise,"Im own perodua axia on 2015.Engine pickup very good during overtake other vehicle example lorry,bus and car.Safety features im satisfied even the price is the middle category but u can get 2 Srs Airbag,Abs,Ebd and etc.Until today July 2020,this car not even give major problem issue.Only wear and tear parts yet.So i hope my review can help others to buy this car."
2015,The low price guarantee,"My experience for this car is very cheap maintenance every month ,easy for finding spare parts too"
2015,Economic car and nice,"Fuel saver..city car,easy to handling and fun.suitable for 1st women car."
2015,Low Fuel & Maintenance,"Super saver for fuel consumption ( 5 speed manual). Low maintenance cost. Great car for city. I have no issue for long distance. Cons : having issue with rear wheel bearing. Mine already clocked at 250,000km since this is my travel partner for travelling outstation/work/balik kampung/anywhere."
2015,Cheap budget car for young adult,"Less petrol usage, low maintenance and perfect for someone who is only starting to work. It was my first car after graduating, and compared to other friends I saved a lot of money not to buy expensive ones straight away even though I was eligible to do it. To me, it was a good decision to be made back in 2015."
2016,Best budget car,"After four years, 80k km, only spend on regular service. Affordable, good FC, sufficient enough for city drive. Pickup a bit slow but still can hit up to 130km/h although not recommended, so advice to other better performance car driver dont look down at this car. Overall match the price tag"
2016,A small package for the family,"A small car, good enough for a young or older person who appreciates the convenience, low maintenance and comfort riding in it. With ample legroom in the back seat, it's comfortable for passengers with long legs. You'll be surprised by the flexibility of this car. Easy to maneuver and park. in tight spaces. While the other side of the coin is that, because this is a small car, it gets the vibration and waves from other passing vehicles that's on high speed. The car shakes like a boat. On fuel consumption, the car is thrifty when it travels on highways but it gets high in city driving. It doesn't have the quickness in power to go uphill on a heavy load. One would have to wait for it to kick in after a while."
2016,The best first car,"This is my first car and I have been using it for 3 years. It is reliable, great for new driver, safe and nice design."
2016,Best kei car,"Good car to use in the city. Saving fuel consumption. For me, perodua is very good after sales service. Their service centre and also repair centre are doing a good job for me and my car."
2016,Overall worth for the price.,30k+ price you cannot expect too much. But overall is good for city drive and short distance driving. Petrol saving with eco mode. Intrerior design ok but for some people maybe felt a bit plastic but for me is just ok. Performance wise is good enough for normal driving but sometime felt a bit hard when try to pick up to overtaking car.
2016,The fuel saver.,The size of this car is suitable and convenience for an unmarried man or woman. Perodua Axia is totally give me best experience ever in driving and save my money for fuel.
2016,Compact car for compact wallet,"Great car for students,new career and even small family.
Km per litres are doing great with 1.0cc only. Even a small car can go and cucuk behind big player on expressway.
Great manuever in town area.
From outside looks kind of small,but when you going inside it feels like you are mini cooper.
It is great for malaysian car maker to porduce this car which is help for small pocket money salaryman.
Awesome for user to make extra money doing grab.
Overall,it satisfied my desire to travel from one point to another which is what a basically do their job"
2016,Its cheap but does it cheerful? : Perodua Axia,"2016 is a significant year as it was my 20 years old anniversary as well the year when I bought my first ride, a 2016 Perodua Axia G (manual) yes fellas, a 3 paddle manual shifters. A basic car as it is that get people from A to B safely. 

Speed : 
Does optioning for manual makes it quicker? Certainly it doesn’t. Powered by 1 litre 3 cylinder with 66hp and 90Nm of torque it does feel laggy especially in first and second gear. On highway though its a different animal. That thing shift on highway. Even on fifth gear it still be able to overtake easily.

Efficiency:
Being well known for the best fuel saving vehicle, it need no introduction. A full tank of fuel can easily covered 500km. The eco indicator does help in preserving the fuel.

Space: 
Practicality is another plus point of the Axia. Interior space got no complaint. The legroom and headroom is more than enough for an average asian like me. I just wish the rear seat could be folded 60:40 for easier access to carry longer items while having passenger.

Ride & handling :
Perodua does not have a credibility on terms of handling. The Axia is no exception. The body roll is significant. A corner is an enemy for Axia. The usage of Silverstone tyre is a nightmare. It got no grip at all when slippery road and the traction is very poor. If you happen to use one change it immediately. It does put a huge different in driving dynamic.

Conclusion :
If you ever need a simple yet reliable workhorse, Axia is a good buy. Go for automatic transmission and avoid the lowest spec as it lacks ABS feature. Should I recommend you to buy one?.. Why not? Its proven"

It's a four stars for me. TQ"

2020,Great as a first car,It is very economical which is great for city use. Air conditioning also works very well and new features such as ABS and TCS are really a blessing. The only downside is its sluggish 4 speed automatic gearbox which feels slow when you try to get up to speed when merging on highways.
2020,Axia Style Experience,"Overall perfomance of thia variant is very satisfying for me. Nothing to complain about the variant. Regarding others complain that this car got no Bluetooth, built in LCD, No turn-Signal on Mirror and no Front Parking sensor. Okay let me tell you guys, what you guys expect on RM38k car ? If they put it all on this variant, then why they still have another S.E n Advance? Thats the marketing strategy man, you cant focus on just one model isnstead you have to think about another model too unless this is the one and only model you put on sale ? i bet if you are the car maker, you'll do the same thing. So mind your word before complaining. Trust me the netizen will and still complaining even the car maker put all the stuff in these variant by another reason like the price are too expensive etc. If you not satisfy with the specs, then go for high specs. So STOP. COMPLAINING"
2020,Best looking Axia ever,Definitely the best looking axia ever made. The Axia 1.0 Style body kit is much more striking with its new orange colour.
2020,Excellent choice of an economical car,"Reliable, high quality and low maintenance. I have 3 of them bought for my childrens. None of them has broken down before!"
